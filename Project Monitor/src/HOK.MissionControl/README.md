# HOK Mission Control .NET

#### The .NET side of Mission Control and how it integrates with Revit. It contains multiple libraries: 

* HOK.MissionControl.dll - main library with all events handled, IUpdaters as well dockable panels created. 
* HOK.MissionControl.Core.dll - core server interaction library. Contains all methods for sending and getting data from MongoDB
* HOK.MissionControl.FamilyPublish.dll - External Command for publishing Family information to Health Monitor part of Mission Control.
* HOK.MissionControl.LinksManager.dll - External Command for managing links, imports and styles. 

###### Release 2018.0.0.7

* Remove obsolete PostToMongo class. 
* Add user info to data posted for model open times, model synch times, session info etc.

###### Release 2018.0.0.6

* Fix to a bug in Server Utilities where file path was not generated properly. It led to wrong file being returned from DB.

###### Release 2018.0.0.5

* Actually connected and release Family Tasks. 
* Also added Sheet Tasks and Sheet management tool.
* Offloaded all tasks related stuff to another thread and integrated with Socket.io. 
* New Button on the ribbon linking back to Mission Control website.
* Bunch of bug fixes.

###### Release 2018.0.0.4

* Added Tasks to Communicator Tab.
* Messaging integration for Tasks form and MongoDB using Sockets.IO.
* New class decorators for serialization and descerialization of MongoDB data.
* Addins now publish user location.
* Cancel button for Family Publish.
* More robust handling of failures while exporting Families.
* Family export logic for updating rather than constantly adding new items. Should improve server response time with smaller paylods.


###### Release 2018.0.0.3

* Fix to Communicator button not always activating the docable panel. 
* Added Communicator icon that changes colors to indicate Communicator state.

###### Release 2018.0.0.2

* Fix to Mission Control Single Session. It was replaced with Link Unload Monitor to better describe the original intent of preventing
users from unloading links. It hijacks Unload for All Users method in Revit, replacing it with our own message. 
* Fix to DTM Tool where it was needlessly popping up on Synch and Reload events. Fix is provided by hijacking of Reload Latest command
with our own reload functionality that first disables DTM Tool. Similar apprach is implemented for Synch functionality. 
* Fix to DTM Tool that was preventing users from creating new Grids, Links, Levels etc. and editing them in the same session of Revit. 
Instead it will now allow users to create them and edit, only upon closing and reopening will they be added to "monitored" elements list
and users will be stopped from messing with it. 
* Addition of Communicator tool, that displays a summary of Health Report in a dockable panel.
* Family Publish tool adds additional properties to its export. Things such as number of reference planes, voids, extrusions, etc. 
* Other small fixes and refactors.

###### Release 2018.0.0.1

* Update to 2018
* Added Logging functionality
* Major code cleanup and refactor
