v.0.1.6
New
-Isolate/Reset view: after overriding colors by elements, a temporary view will be created with isolating the colored elements
 double-click the command button will reset the view.
 
-Clear Colors: If a view corresponding to a color scheme has contained colored elements by this tool,
it will remove the overriding colors and restore back to the initial state of the model element color.

- Empty Value Entry: If some of filtered elements have empty value of the selected parameter, 
it will create an default color definition entry called <empty value>

Fix
-Restoring custom entries when switching back and forth between "By Value" and "By Range"
-Displaying Yes/No value insteading of raw integer value 0/1
-Extensible storage to memorize the recently opened BCF file
-Color Definition entries with parameter values as displayed in Revit UI such as "245.00 SF" with their units
